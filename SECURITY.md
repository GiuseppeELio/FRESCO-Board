# Security Policy

The FRESCO device is not affected by security problems or any kind of vulnerability. It only uses WiFi connection to transfer data to InfluxDB V2 (cloud or local) and to Grafana (cloud or local) to visualize the collected data. 
The overall security relies on these third-party resources and the fact that FRESCO will be connected to academic networks (well protected by their firewall) or private WiFi networks. 

## Supported Versions
